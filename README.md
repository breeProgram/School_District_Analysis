# School_District_Analysis
## Introduction
A city district school board approached looking to prepare analysis for the city schools testing proficiency. After completing the analysis, the school board was notified that the data file shows evidence of academic dishonesty with the math and reading grades for Thomas High School ninth grade. They asked to replace those scores with NaNs then repeat the analysis and explain how the district summary was affected.
